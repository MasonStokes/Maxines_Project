        <h1>History of Maxine's</h1>

        <div id="history-text">
            <p>The building that now houses Maxine&#39;s Ballroom was built in 1884 as a Masonic Hall. The Masons used the top story; the first floor was occupied by a general merchandise store. In 1894 an adjacent building was erected to the west. Two doors connected the upper stories, adding a second, more utilitarian, ballroom to the Mason’s premises.</p>
            <p>By 1902, the co-joined buildings had been sold to the Odd Fellows, who used the top floor, including both ballrooms and a warren of small offices and passageways (complete with secret password speaking tubes and sliding peepholes), for lodge meetings and dances. On the ground floor a dry goods store replaced the general mercantile. During the war years, the ballrooms were opened to the public on many occasions, and USO dances were regularly held upstairs for the entertainment of soldiers stationed at Camp Adair.</p>
            <p>The dry goods store remained until 1940, when it was replaced by a hardware store, then a series of antique shops. In 2000 the ground floor of the 1884 half of the building was remodeled into a veterinary clinic.</p>
            <p>The Independence Odd Fellows lodge remained active until the 1950s. After the lodge disbanded, the upstairs ballrooms were sporadically used for youth activities and meetings, but were mostly forgotten and gradually fell into disrepair.</p>
            <p>In 2011 the entire 1884 upstairs story was restored and made available for rental for special events as Maxine’s Ballroom. (The 1894 ballroom, less ornate to begin with, and more damaged by the ravages of time, was tagged with the moniker “the ugly ballroom” and remains a private storage area).</p>
            <p>Maxine&#39;s Ballroom is featured in the Independence Ghostwalk, held each September as the kickoff event for the Independence Hop and Heritage Festival. No ghosts haunt Maxine&#39;s (that we know of), but the unusual story behind Maxine’s naming is the reason for its inclusion.</p>
            <p>In keeping with usual Odd Fellow practice, the Independence Lodge obtained a human skeleton for use in lodge initiation rituals.  The local community was vaguely aware of this, and was also aware that when the Odd Fellows sold the building in the 1950s, the skeleton remained upstairs.</p>
            <p>Local rumor named the skeleton Max Smith, with some sources going further to identify Max as “the last grand Pooh-Bah” of the Odd Fellows, who had directed that he and his elegant mahogany coffin remain behind after the lodge disbanded.  He was said to preside over the dusty upstairs rooms in bony elegance, dressed in a tux and tails</p>
            <p>In reality, “Max” had never been an Odd Fellow, and was not even “Max.”</p>
            <p>When the current owners purchased the building, they found a human skeleton in an unassuming wooden coffin in one of the upstairs offices.  It was wired together, as though it had at one time been a doctor’s model.  It was also determined upon examination to be the remains of a small adult woman.</p>
            <p>Apparently vague rumors of an old skeleton in an old building are one thing, but obvious evidence at the time of a property transaction is a different story. So the skeleton went off with the police, presumably destined for a proper burial.  The new owners (now the managers of Maxine’s) decided to name the ballroom in honor of the unknown woman whose remains had been used in shadowy rituals and then left mostly forgotten for decades. We hope she loved to dance.</p>
