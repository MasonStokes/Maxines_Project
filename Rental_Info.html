                <!-- <p>$50 per hour to a maximum of $250 for the day for weekday rentals (Sunday to Thursday).</p>
                <p>$75 per hour to a maximum of $300 for the day for weekend rentals (Friday and Saturday). <br> (Regularly recurring events on weekdays--such as exercise classes--may be eligible for a discounted hourly price).</p>
                <p>A refundable cleaning/security deposit (generally $200) is required for all rentals. The deposit may vary somewhat depending on the size and nature of the event. (For example, dance classes with no food served may have a smaller deposit, and events requesting an exception to the alcohol policy will have a larger deposit). Contact the manager for more information.</p>

                <h3>Deposit Refund Policy:</h3>
                <p><b>Cleaning/Security Deposit</b></p>
                <p>In order for full refund of the cleaning/security deposit, Maxineâ€™s must be left in the condition it was found.  A full description of cleaning policies may be found in the Rental Contract, but with the exception of garbage removal and wet mopping of the dance floor, all cleaning must be done by the renter.  If more than one half hour of additional cleaning is required after an event, the cleaning charges will be deducted from the deposit at the rate of $25 per hour.  Any damages to property or equipment will also be deducted from the deposit and billed to the renter if they exceed the amount of the deposit.</p>

                <p><b>Reservation Deposit ($50 to reserve the date)</b></p>
                <p>This deposit should be enclosed with the initial rental application and will be applied to the rental fee, all other fees/deposits must be paid in full prior to key pick up.  It will not be refunded if the event is canceled with 14 days or less notice.</p> -->

                <h3>No Alcohol Policy:</h3>
                <p>Exceptions may rarely be granted, but must be discussed with the manager well ahead of the event, and any agreed-upon exceptions must be written into the rental contract. Exceptions will likely require a larger damage deposit and potentially other additional charges, and the renter will be required to have a bartender with a license and sufficient insurance serving all alcohol. A copy of the license must be presented along with rental documents. <b>No exceptions to the policy will be granted at the last minute.</b></p>
